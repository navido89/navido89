### Hi there and welcome to my profile 👋 !

I am Navid Mashinchi a Senior Data Scientist at VF Corporation, passionate about building scalable AI and machine learning systems that drive real-world impact across global brands. At VF, I support the Vans brand 🛹, one of the most iconic names in apparel and footwear, by developing Machine Learning & AI solutions that power personalization, forecasting, and customer experience innovation. In addition to 

Previously, I worked at Kohl’s, where I led machine learning initiatives in product recommendation and forecasting, helping to enhance retail decision-making at scale.

My journey into data science started in an unexpected place. On the soccer field ⚽. I played professionally in Germany :de: &nbsp; and Canada :canada:, and later joined the Vancouver Whitecaps FC (MLS) as an analyst while completing my degree at the University of British Columbia. That experience sparked my passion for technology, data, and problem-solving, ultimately leading me into the world of data science.

Outside of work, I’m an Adjunct Professor at the University of Denver, where I teach graduate-level Machine Learning and Database Systems, and I also mentor aspiring data scientists through SharpestMinds. 

I am fluent in Farsi, German and English. While I am not working on any projects or studying, I spend time with my family :family_man_man_girl_boy: , in the gym :muscle: , play soccer :running_man: :soccer: &nbsp;or read data science blogs :newspaper:	. I truly believe that there is nothing more beautiful in life than learning new skills and reinventing yourself to become better as every day passes.

⚡ Fun fact: Played the violine :violin: &nbsp; for 10 years :blush:
